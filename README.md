# discord-big-text
This is a relatively simple Python script that converts text into emojis. There are two scripts, for two purposes:

- no_nitro.py, which converts text into regional indicator characters
- nitro.py, which converts text into the custom emojis I made. You can use them yourself by joining the servers seen here: https://olivercjcox.uk/discord-emoji-packs/
